# Branch Structure
This repository uses the default branch to distribute the stable releases and uses a development branch for development.  As a result of this, pull requests should be based off the development branch and merged into the development branch, not the default branch.  Pull requests based off of the default branch can be changed to merge into the development branch at any time through the GitHub UI.  A GitHub action will run for each pull request to check whether an unauthorized merge is being proposed.  The development branch will be merged periodically into the default branch for stable releases.  Fixes for severe bugs in the latest release are allowed to be merged directly to the default branch and will be manually approved by those with the authorization to do so.
